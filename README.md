## 🤖 Use of LLM (Large Language Model)

During the development of this project, I used ChatGPT (an LLM) to assist with:
- Understanding React concepts like `useState` and `.map()`
- Writing the README.md structure
- Learning how to deploy the app on CodeSandbox
- Debugging minor errors in JSX and CSS

All final implementation and testing were done by me.
